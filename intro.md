# Hi, I'm Trong Tuyen!

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a passionate student currently pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence at FPT University. My primary areas of interest and expertise lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. I am fascinated by the endless possibilities AI offers in transforming the way we interact with technology.

In my journey as an AI enthusiast, I have been exploring various domains, including search and recommendation systems. I believe that by harnessing the power of data and AI, we can create intelligent systems that revolutionize user experiences and make a positive impact on society.

Aside from my AI pursuits, I possess strong skills in frontend development using ReactJS and NextJS. I enjoy crafting interactive and user-friendly interfaces that enhance the overall user experience. On the backend side, I am proficient in frameworks like Django and Flask, enabling me to build robust and scalable web applications. Furthermore, I have experience in iOS development and am well-versed in Docker, which allows me to containerize applications for efficient deployment.

My GitHub repository showcases a collection of my projects, where I apply my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems. I am always eager to collaborate and learn from fellow developers, so feel free to explore my work and reach out to me with any exciting opportunities or ideas.
Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you!
